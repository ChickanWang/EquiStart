# EquiStart (CS 492 Final Group Project)

Equistart is an interactive, decision-based experience where players take on the role of a CEO running a background screening company. Through a series of ethically and technologically related scenarios, players make decisions that impact various aspects of their company's operations, including financial performance, employee satisfaction, public perception, and workforce diversity. Each scenario presents a set of choices with immediate feedback that reflects how these decisions affect key company metrics. These feedback loops were designed to illustrate the real-world implications of ethical decision-making and the application of technology in business. The game incorporates research-based scenarios, allowing players to access credible information to guide their decisions, ensuring that the game not only entertains but also educates users about complex issues surrounding ethics, security, and technology in the workplace.
